- Wait until it is 10AM.
- Call the elevator by pushing the up button.
- View the buttons, starting from the bottom
	- If the button you are viewing isn't 42, go to the next button
	- If the button you are viewing is 42, and it isn't pushed push it
	- Otherwise, since 42 is already pushed, just wait
