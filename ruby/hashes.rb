## A program that will allow an interior designer to enter the details of a given client: Collect the client's name, age, # of children, decor theme, etc.

# Ask user for their name. (To be stored as a string)

# Ask the user for their age. (To be stored as an integer)

# Ask the user for # of children. (To be stored as an integer)

# Ask the user for their decor theme. (To be stored as a string)

# Ask the user if they are interested in our special pricing plan. (To be stored as a boolean value)

# Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.

# Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). Assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash (no need to handle user errors).


# If the designer says "none", then leave the hash alone.



# Print the latest version of the hash.
