# R0: Make a Plan

**Instructions:** Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

## Resources that will help:

* Google
* StackOverflow
* Various sites that have tutorials (w3Schools, etc.)

## How often should you stop and test what you just learned?

Whenever coming across something drastically different or completely new from what I'd seen before.

## Are breaks important?

* If I'm feeling overwhelmed or tired, then I'll take a 5 minute break to get up and walk around (rehydrate and whatnot).
