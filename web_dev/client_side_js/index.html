  <h1>Giant Panda</h1>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Order:</strong> Carnivora</li>
    <li><strong>Family:</strong> Ursidae</li>
    <li><strong>Genus and species:</strong><em> Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Geographic Distribution</h2>
  <p>Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing, and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.</p>

  <h2>Habitat</h2>
  <p>Giant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo, at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests, often shrouded in heavy clouds.</p>

  <h2 id="physdesc">Physical Description</h2>
  <p>The giant panda, a black-and-white bear, has a body typical of bears. It has black fur on ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage into their shade-dappled snowy and rocky surroundings.</p>

  <p>Aside from the stylistic differences that make this site better than my index.html page, this site is formatted using CSS. It's tempting to format this early webpage using HTML but it is important to hold off. Using the semantic tags, it's easier to put certain elements of the page into easily looked at categories for future formatting.</p>
